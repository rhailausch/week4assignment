README FILE

The purpose of this repo was to use the data from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set to produce a tidy dataset that contains the average for each subject and for each of the 6 actitvies across all of the mean or standard deviation variables. 

The run_analysis.R file was the only script used to produce the tidy dataset. The tidy dataset (output as a txt file) can be reproduced by running the run_analysis.R script. (see codebook for a detailed explanation of the steps involved)

This repo contains:
- README.md file
- CodeBook.md file
- run_analysis.R script
- tidydataset.txt file


This repo uses the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set (found online at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)
